### Financial-Classification-Model
## Objective
Lets analyze a dataset of customer bank loans. The idea is to construct reliable classification machine learning models, compare perforamnces, and draw conclusions based on insights brought to life form the data. Ideally the conclusions will provide a reliable prediction model advising credit unions to assess risk from a tactical standpoint while making strong business decisions. Utilizing such risk analyses gives them an edge on loan allocation and has the potential to return higher quarterly numbers.
## Findings
My dataset consists of mostly relevant data, only a few columns were dropped and the rest were cleaned up without much trouble. The final structure of my dataframes allowed my three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest) to return relatively favorable results.
## Conclusion
The favorable results present several possibilities. I searched for an origin of this data, but that is still unknown at this point. So that leaves a few questions unasnwered, is this all from one credit union? Has it been gathered as a random sample of big data accross many demographics, areas, etc? Although, a few consisitencies I found were the majority of borrowers have 700+ credit scores, the majority of the data points are satisified loans, and lots more outlined in the slides presentation.
